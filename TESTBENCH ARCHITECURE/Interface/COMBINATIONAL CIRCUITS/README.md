# INTERFACE
```
Interface is used to encapsulate communication between design blocks, and between design and verification blocks.

Encapsulating communication between blocks facilitates design reuse.

Interfaces can be accessed through ports as a single item.

Signals can be added to and removed easily from an interface without modifying any port list.

Interface can contain the connectivity, synchronization, and optionally, the functionality of the communication between two or more blocks.
